# Thunder Code Editor

Thunder Code Editor is a **lightweight, blazing-fast code editor** built entirely in **C++** using the **Win32 API** and **GDI+** for rendering.  
It’s designed for speed, extensibility, and customization — with support for themes, syntax highlighting, and an extension API.  
Currently **under development**, but already packed with features that make it stand out.

## 📦 Extension API

Thunder comes with an **Extension API** that allows developers to:
- Add **new language parsers**
- Modify **syntax highlighting rules**
- Add **custom commands**
- Create **theme packs**

Extensions are loaded dynamically and can interact with the editor’s core.

## 🎨 Themes

Themes are **JSON-based** and control:
- Background colors
- Syntax colors
- UI element styling

Example theme snippet:
```json
{
    "mainWindow": "#0a0a0a",
    "titlebar": "#0e0e0e",
    "syntaxKeywords": "#ffcc66",
    "syntaxStrings": "#99cc99"
}
