Thunder Code Editor is a **lightweight, blazing-fast code editor** built entirely in **C++** using the **Win32 API** and **GDI+** for rendering.  
It’s designed for speed, extensibility, and customization — with support for themes, syntax highlighting, and an extension API.  
Currently **under development**, but already packed with features that make it stand out.
